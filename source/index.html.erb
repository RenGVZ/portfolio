    <h1> Developer | <small>Based in Tokyo</small>ðŸ—¼</h1>
    <p>Hi my name is Gavin and I'm a Full Stack Developer currently living in Tokyo. The technologies I have experience with are <strong>Ruby On Rails, Ruby, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Figma </strong> and <strong> Bootstrap</strong>. I enjoy building things that make life more interesting and I'm always looking to learn more. <strong>Below are a few of my most recent projects:</strong></p>

            <p>A Ruby-On-Rails website made to boost a client's exposure online</p>
            
            <p>Using figma to create a mockup I then proceded to code the entire site in HTML/CSS and Javascript, using Ruby and Active Record's database functionality when necessary</p>
            <p>While creating this project I honed in on sound design principles and made responsiveness a key feature of the website.</p>
            <p>This was my introduction to making stylish and visually-appealing freelance projects.</p>

            <p>kiota is an apartment-hunting app designed for people living in Tokyo, Japan. With kiota, finding an apartment has never been easier or more fun.</p>
            <p>It makes use of an engaging series of questions to gauge what is most important to the user. Then, in 'Tinder-like' style it presents the user with a series of properties they may choose to 'swipe right' or 'swipe-left' on.</p>
            <p>Once they have selected their favorites, the user can then get into contact with the property owner or real estate agent to set up a time and place to view the properties they've liked.</p>
            <p>kiota uses many technologies, mainly Ruby on Rails but also Javascript, Active Record database management, Bootstrap and CSS. Designed primarily for mobile users.</p>

            <p>Game Exchange is an app that connects two kinds of people.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>People who want to rent their old games for cash</li>
              <li>People who want to play the newest games but not have to pay the high prices to own them</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Both of these people can be satisfied with Game Exchange, a market place app that connects people who love their video games.</p>
            <p>Game Exchange was a project created throughout the course of 1 week using Ruby on Rails, HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>This was my first group project and it introduced me to collaborating with team members through Git. I also gained the valuable experience of using teamwork to tackle significant coding challenges.</p>
